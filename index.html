    <h2>Info about Sheepadoodles</h2>
    <p>
      The <em>Sheepadoodle</em> is awesome because
      <strong>they are very cute and fluffy</strong>. Sheepadoodles are known to
      be black and white, but they are sometimes other colors. They are named
      sheepadoodles because they are a mix between a sheep dog and poodle.
